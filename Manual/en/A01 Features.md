# A01 Features

Yu Writer is designed to create a comfortable, simple, efficient, smooth, distraction-free writing environment, the main features:

## Integrated document library, organize and manage documents in one place

Yu Writer document library is based on a local file system, and uses open format to store the document and data. If you no longer use Yu Writer, you can still use the operating system's own file Manager to manage the libraries that created by Yu Writer, and of course you can use any text editor to open and edit documents that created by Yu Writer.

## The editing history is detailed to every word you typed, and the document is automatically saved

Whether program crash or a mistake, your work will never be lost again.

## Supports Markdown Format

Markdown is a kind of plain text format, append with some simple and easy to remember the mark and symbol, it can produce the rich format document. Writing a document using the Markdown format reduces the energy that spent on typesetting and text formatting, allowing you to focus on content creation, keeping your hands on the keyboard at maximum, ensuring consistency in your creative thinking and recording inspirations quickly.

If you are not fully familiar with the Markdown syntax, Yu Writer has built-in graphical editing assistant tools to help you complete documents, such as links, pictures, task lists, tables editing tools. In addition Yu Writer also has built-in Markdown syntax check and document beautified tool.

## Powerful text-processing

Separating some numbers with vertical bars will result a "table", you can use the `Tab` key to move freely in the cell of the table, the table will automatically adjust the column width according to the content, and the context menu can also sort the data in the table, increase the deleted rows or columns, and so on. It feels like editing a table in a spreadsheet application, but all of this is done in plain text.

## Shortcuts and auto-complete for improved editing efficiency

When you enter two asterisks, the editor automatically finishes the following two asterisks to indicate bold formatting, or, after entering a line of text, pressing `Alt + Enter` automatically becomes the heading of the correct level. Yu Writer will iterate over hundreds of contextual criteria before automatic completion to achieve accurate, not mechanical, completion.

## Support Slides and Presentation

## Supports tabs, multiple windows, outline, quick open, collect tools

Yu Writer provides a heavy-writing user with a strong firepower, the ability to write complex documents, Yu Writer even supports opening two windows side-by-side to edit different parts of the same document.

## Supports directive, chart, LaTeX mathematical

Yu Writer introduced a "directive" (which is generally word, such as `@toc` and `@chart`) without adding or changing the markdown syntax, which greatly expands the scope of Markdown documents. For example, just add a `@chart` instruction in front of the table to render the table as a bar chart, a pie chart or  a stack chart.
